# Social Network Analysis and Spectral Clustering in Graphs and Networks Using R Programming 
A project for the course Statistical Software 3. This project is a more theoretical approach to the topic. It implemented various SNA algorithms, including centrality measures, community detection, and network visualisation. Additionally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was applied to classify nodes based on their similarity within the network and K-Means clustering algorithm was used to partition networks into cohesive subgroups or clusters based on connectivity patterns.
